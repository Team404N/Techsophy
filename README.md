 Claims Automation System

This project helps automate insurance claim processing. It can read claim documents (PDFs, images, or text), extract important information like name, policy ID, and claim amount, and decide whether the claim is simple enough to approve automatically â€” or needs a human to look at it.

 What It Does

- Accepts uploaded claim documents (PDF, image, TXT)
- Extracts data using OCR + regex (no ML needed)
- Scores claim complexity
- Automatically routes: simple claims are approved, complex ones are flagged
